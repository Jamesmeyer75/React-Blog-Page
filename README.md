# React-Blog-Page
A blog page with user auth and individual profiles. Technologies include React, Express, and MySQL. A full description will be added once the project is 
finished. Click the link in the about section to see the changes and updates as they are added. Currently, there a nav-bar with the routing set up and mobile 
responsiveness added. The home page has three different containers with all the blog posts. I will be working on the backend next.
